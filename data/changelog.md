# ARCHITECT CG-223 // SYSTEM REGISTRY v4.0

> **Report Generated:** 2026-06-02 at 06:30:53 PM (Bamako Time, GMT+0)
> **Build Version:** v3.0.5 | **Node:** BAMAKO_223 🇲🇱
> **Architect:** Moussa Fofana | **License:** Proprietary
> **Architecture:** Per-Server Partitioning (Composite PK: id, guild_id)

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The ARCHITECT CG-223 neural grid operates on a **per-server partitioning architecture**, ensuring complete data isolation across **7 servers** serving **105 Discord users** via **102 active plugins**.

**Key Architectural Feature:** Each user record is uniquely identified by a composite primary key `(id, guild_id)`, guaranteeing that XP, credits, levels, and all progression data are strictly scoped to their originating server. No cross-server data leakage is possible under this schema.

System metrics remain stable with no configuration changes detected since the last restart.

## 5. SERVER INTELLIGENCE REPORT

> Per-server statistics reflect the partitioned user data architecture. Each server maintains isolated user records with composite keys `(id, guild_id)`.

## 6. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### 6.1 Per-Server Partitioning Schema

The v2.0 architecture introduces a fundamental schema change: the `users` table now uses a **composite primary key** `(id, guild_id)` instead of a single `id` column. This ensures:

- **Complete Data Isolation:** User progress (XP, credits, levels) is strictly scoped per server
- **No Cross-Server Leakage:** A user's data in Server A is entirely independent of Server B
- **Efficient Queries:** All user lookups include `guild_id` for indexed retrieval
- **Scalable Cache:** In-memory cache uses `${userId}:${guildId}` composite keys

### 6.2 Cache & Write Strategy

- **Cache Key Format:** `${userId}:${guildId}` — O(1) Map lookup
- **Batch Writes:** INSERT OR REPLACE with all 17 columns, guild_id explicitly populated
- **Circuit Breaker:** 5 consecutive failures trigger 60s cooldown
- **Cache TTL:** 1 hour stale entry expiry, 30-minute janitor cycle

### 6.3 Event Systems

| Event | Handler | Data Scope |
|-------|---------|------------|
| GuildMemberAdd | Welcome Matrix | Per-server settings |
| GuildMemberRemove | Goodbye Matrix | Per-server settings |
| MessageCreate | Leveling + AFK + Commands | Per-server partitioning |
| InteractionCreate | Buttons + Slash | Per-server or global |

### 6.4 Environment Configuration

## 7. ARCHITECT'S NOTES

This registry is **auto-generated** on every system restart and reflects the exact state of the ARCHITECT CG-223 neural grid at boot time. All metrics are captured in real-time from the BAMAKO_223 node.

**v4.0 Changelog Engine Changes:**
- Per-server partitioning statistics now report both total partitions and unique users
- Architecture change detection monitors schema version transitions
- Database stats distinguish between global-scoped and per-server-scoped tables
- Composite key metrics provide visibility into data distribution across guilds

> *"The grid adapts. The grid isolates. The grid prevails."*
